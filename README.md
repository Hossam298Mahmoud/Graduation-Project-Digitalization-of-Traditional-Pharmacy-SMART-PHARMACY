# Smart Pharmacy 


## Introduction and state the problem:-
The smart pharmacy mainly provides accurate medication dispensing, reduces waiting times, the absence of medication errors, and an increased number of drugs dispensed daily. Nowadays, Hospitals and health institutions have been working on that by adopting specialized automation software.
This digital transformation contributed to changing advanced pharmacy management systems that are based on big data technologies, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing.
The smart pharmacy reflects the role of technology in medication dispensing without human intervention and without any errors. Also, it has achieved outstanding outcomes in terms of raising the level of effectiveness and operations efficiency, reducing the waiting time of patients to receive the service, and establishing a more efficient stock management while reducing medical errors using barcodes and keeping medicines in the best condition.

## Project description:-
Medications are dispensed in the smart pharmacy by a robot that picks up the medication and prints a label with patient and prescription information, then delivers it to the pharmacistâ€™s window in a few seconds. The robotic pharmacy is also concerned with using advanced technological techniques through the design and operation of specialized software and the application of robots in pharmacies, as well as the computer systems necessary to manage them.                                                                             

The robot works with great capabilities and high technologies without any possibility of error, and therefore the smart pharmacy is the solution to protect the patient from medication dispensing errors. Not only that, the automation of work in the pharmacy has contributed to enhancing the effectiveness of operations using barcodes and artificial intelligence, in identifying the drug package through its dimensions as a tool to reduce medical errors, in addition to designing control and follow-up points and integrating them into the system to ensure the quality and continuity of service, such as monitoring the validity of medicines, and alerting when Near expiry dates, monitoring drug availability and near-expiration alerts, automating inventory and inventory management. Figure 2 shows the simple prototype which we are working on it.
